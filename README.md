#Java, Maven, TestNG Starter

This is a simple project that would allow anyone to get up and running with Java, Maven, Selenium and TestNG


## Getting Started
There are a few things we need before running out tests. These are:

1. An IDE / Text Editor (In this example we used Eclipse)
2. Install Maven and add it to your path
3. Install TestNG plugin for Eclipse. (This step may be skipped if you are using another IDE / Text Editor)
